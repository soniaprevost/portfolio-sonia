# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      whoami: Hi there!
      description: After a couple of years asking people to solve my code problems for me, I’ve decided to learn web development @ Le Wagon. I now work on a daily basis with Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 and other bits (like versioning with Git and Github) to develop great web apps. This is what I'm currently doing @ Agorize where I manage and maintain 20 apps.
        <br><br>Do you have a great product? Cool! I have a knack to make people believe in crazy ideas I love. Yes, I have a thing for federating people. This is quite useful when working with different teams (marketing, business and product teams) to get the best soution.
        <br><br>So let’s meet and have a chat about what you’re working on.
