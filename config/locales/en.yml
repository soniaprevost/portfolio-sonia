# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      description: I love to solve problems. Put a problem in front of me and I’m up and running to tackle it. This is why after a couple of years asking my younger brother (a dev student @Epitech) to solve my coding problems for me,
        I’ve decided to learn web development myself. I now know enough Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 and other bits (like versioning with Git and Github) to manage and develop web apps.
        You have a great product? Cool! I have a knack to make people believe in crazy ideas I love. Yes, I have a thing for federating people. This bit is quite useful when working in a heterogeneous team that needs cohesion. So let’s meet and have a chat about what you’re working on.
